# YZG
This project is a 2D autonomous car and traffic simulation featuring pathfinding, built using a custom game engine and Pixi.js.
You can access the live, up-to-date demo [here](https://bilis.im/yzg/src).  

If you'd prefer to host it yourself, make sure to run it on a local server. Directly opening the `index.html` file won't work because browsers prevent local file access for security reasons.

The actions are currently rule-based but using a neural network would not require too many changes and is already planned for a future update in the project's roadmap. The map is generated randomly at the start.

You can set the path for the car with the orange rectangle below by clicking on an accessible road. Alternatively, you can manually drive the car using the WASD keys or the on-screen buttons.
